# WeatherApp
This project was developed in Vanilla JS. It is an App that connects to the openweathermap through an API key, gathers specific information about the
weather on the user's current location and presents them in a responsive app. On the right top corner the location is displayed dynamically, on the main box we
can see detailed information about the present day, and in the bottom section there is the information of the whole week, that scroll in the Y-axis if the window
gets too small.
